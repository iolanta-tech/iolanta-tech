<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-language-markdown:{ .lg .middle } __Markdown rocks!__

    ---

    It is a simple, readable, lightweight text formatting language, widely used to build, for instance, static sites and project documentation.

-   :material-table:{ .lg .middle } __…but its tables do not ☹__

    ---

    Markdown has syntax for tables, but it is a pain to write, read, and especially maintain.

-   :simple-yaml:{ .lg .middle } __Generate them from YAML with Iolanta!__

    ---

    Write your table definition as a YAML file and get an HTML table rendered for you.
