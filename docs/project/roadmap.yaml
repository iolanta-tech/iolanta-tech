              - title: Clear Introduction
                description: The website could benefit from a more detailed introduction. While it's clear that "Iolanta" is a visualization framework, it's unclear what makes it unique or why someone should use it over other visualization frameworks. This could include its unique selling points, key features, or the problems it aims to solve.
                is-blocked-by:
                  - title: Document how data might be shared among visualizations

              - title: Navigation
                description: The navigation structure seems a bit complex. It might be helpful to simplify and make it more intuitive. For example, it's not immediately clear what the difference is between the first set of links (iolanta, Tables, Vocabularies) and the second set below it. If they serve different purposes or lead to different types of content, make sure that this is clear to the user.
              - title: Visual Appeal
                description: The website is currently quite text-heavy, and could be made more engaging with the use of visuals, especially given that it's a visualization framework. Using more visuals could also help to explain how Iolanta works and what it can do.
              - title: Examples
                description: The examples provided are very useful, but it may be beneficial to provide a bit more context around them. For example, for the "Tables" example, a brief explanation of what the example is demonstrating could be provided.
              - title: Calls to Action
                description: There doesn't seem to be a clear call to action. If the goal is for visitors to try Iolanta, download it, contribute to its development, or something else, this should be clearly and prominently stated on the front page.
              - title: Design and Layout
                description: The design and layout could use some refinement. The use of white space, text formatting (e.g., size, font, color), and other design elements could be improved to make the site more visually appealing and easy to read.
              - title: Footer
                description: The footer contains a copyright notice and a reference to the site being made with Material for MkDocs. This is good, but it might be helpful to also include links to important pages or resources, contact information, or a short site description.
