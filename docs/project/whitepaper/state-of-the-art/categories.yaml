  - rdfs:label: Browsers & exploratory tools
    good: yes
    notes: A browser is an interactive tool to explore Linked Data. It might be also able to re-use an existing Linked Data visualization and possibly customize it before said visualization is reused in a book or in an article, — like this one. We should look at existing Linked Data browsers to see if that is possible.
  - rdfs:label: Tools using multiple visualization types
    good: yes
    notes: For each particular task, a different visualization might be required, — thus, it is necessary for the visualization system to support more than one visualization type.
  - rdfs:label: Graph-based visualization tools
    good: no
    notes: Only one supported visualization type — a graph — is not enough for our purposes.
  - rdfs:label: Domain & vocabulary specific, & device oriented tools
    good: no
    notes: Authors might use arbitrary vocabularies; we need to support any kind of those.
  - rdfs:label: Ontology visualization tools
    good: no
    notes: Only one supported visualization domain — ontologies & vocabularies — is not enough for our purposes.
